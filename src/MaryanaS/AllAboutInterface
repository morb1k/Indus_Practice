/*
• It’s a template, a blueprint of a class
• The interface keyword is used to create interface
• Specifies the behavior(s) that a class should implement
• Provides additional methods that class(es) need.
• We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces
Properties of Interface
• Variables are static & final by default
• Interface can have static methods, abstract methods and default methods only
• Public is the only access modifier that can be used in interface (except for static
methods which can be declared as private after since JDK 9) and given by default
• The Abstract keyword is given by default to the abstract methods of interface
• An interface can not have instance variables
• An interface can not have instance methods
• An interface can not have constructors
• An interface can not have blocks
• We can not create objects from interface
• Class can extend only one superclass, but java allows a class to
implement multiple interfaces
• The implements keyword is used to inherit from interface(s)
• When a class implements multiple interfaces, it must implement
(override) all the abstract methods
